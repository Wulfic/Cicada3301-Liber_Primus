# TODO — Liber Primus

The working plan. **Write a plan here before the first edit** (AGENTS.md): goal, approach, rejected
alternatives, what you're *not* doing, blast radius, rollback. When a stage is done, collapse it to one line
under "Done" with its commits. The full text stays in git history. Status and next research steps live in

### W — byte keys as random tabulae, in step, flat negatives (2026-10-01)

Tracker §1 item 1. Declared before `tools/run_stage_w.py` exists.

**Model:** c_i = σ_{k_{t+i}}(p_i). k is the raw byte stream (256 classes) of one named file, read cyclically. σ_v is an
independent secret permutation for each byte value v, and t is any start phase (a uniform prior over every phase of
the key). In step: a would-be doublet is re-keyed by a fresh draw that consumes no key value (C14 excludes skip-next).
**Classings (5):** `wisdom_hint.txt` raw (3,368 B), the same reversed, and `page_17.bin`, `page_21.bin`, `page_43.bin`
raw (58,152 B each). This is the complete set of named byte sources on disk that are longer than 1,000 values:
`folly_hint.txt` is byte-identical to `wisdom_hint.txt` (same MD5), `folly_rev_hint.txt` is it reversed, `page_00`
gives 991 bytes, `page_08` 150, and the grid 256. Sources of 1,000 values or fewer are already C9 in step (§17).
**Alignments (10):** LP2 continuous (7–15), and each section 7…15 with its own phase.
**Not already excluded because:** C16 leaves V_eff > 153 open, and these sit at 236.5 and 254.8–254.9 (P 8.7 × 10⁻⁴
and 1.3 × 10⁻³, above the 10⁻⁴ line). C9 reaches period 1,000; these are 3,368 and 58,152. Stage S scored this exact
family, but that run is void (§17): its negative controls were uneven random-σ ciphers.
**Already seen:** stage S's LP2 rows for these 50 decodes (best +0.84). The detector, α and keys here are the same,
so the LP2 numbers are fixed in advance and will be asserted equal to `stage_s_candidates.tsv`. What this stage adds is
the controls, which decide the verdict. Before declaring, I scored one synthetic flat cipher per size against
`page_17.bin` raw (729: −0.8, 3,316: −79.4, 12,956: −910.0) to time the run. No LP2 data was touched.
**Detector:** `alphabets.log_mean_lr` (mean DM LR over all phases, α = `dm_alpha` of the solved plaintext). Family
N = 50, bound 50·e^−30 ≈ 4.7 × 10⁻¹².
**Controls, per (classing, alignment), at that alignment's exact length,** from `run_stage_s.control_text` (solved
words, shuffled):
- positive ×5: `alphabets.encrypt_alphabets` under the key at a random phase, keep 0.19;
- **flat negative ×5:** `keys.encrypt_dodging` with a uniform random key (fresh, keep 0.19), scored against the
  named key;
- plus a real-data null per classing: the shuffled key on LP2 continuous.

**Rules (declared now):**
- **VOID** if any flat negative or real-data null scores ≥ 30.
- An alignment is **testable** for a classing if all 5 positives score ≥ 30. Otherwise it is **untestable**.
- **PASS** if any LP2 decode scores ≥ 30.
- **EXCLUDED** (classing × alignment): testable, and LP2 < 30.

**Expected:** continuous testable for all 5 (stage S positives +1,659…+1,769 at 12,956), section 15 (3,316) testable,
section 11 (1,894) borderline (stage S +35…+49), sections ≤ 1,729 and segment 10 untestable. Every testable alignment
excluded.
**Not doing:** desync (1 % desync kills this detector, so the exclusion holds in step only); the mod-29 and rejection
mappings (already C16); structured tabulae (Latin-square → C17–C19); new sources.
**Outputs:** `tools/run_stage_w.py` (`--quick`), `reference/findings/stage_w_controls.tsv`, `stage_w_candidates.tsv`,
a test pinning the headline, findings §21. **Blast radius:** additive. **Rollback:** `git revert` the stage commits.

## Owner items

- [ ] **Tokens in `.claude/mcp.vscode-reference.json`** (GitHub PAT, mem0, context7) are plaintext. They were never
  committed or pushed (full-history scan on 2026-09-29), so rotating them is optional. Consider VS Code `inputs`
  (`promptString`, `password: true`) instead of hardcoding them.

| Date | Stage | Result | Commits |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-01 | **C/K rendering** (user report) | Page READMEs rendered solved words with one spelling per rune: CNOW, LICE, BOOC, THINC, ASCED (also UOICE, INSTRUCTIAN, THNGS). Display only: ciphers, detectors, running-key models and keyword spellings all use rune index 5 (C = K = Q), so no result changes. `verify.render_words` takes each word from the translation after `word_matches` confirms the runes spell it, and raises otherwise; segment 2's 13 square cells (no English) stay canonical on a labelled line. Tests: rendered = English word for word, all 19 K kept. 17 page files regenerated. Rejected: a context guess for K; changing `LATIN` | this |
| 2026-10-01 | **V** named keyword Quagmire | Declared first (`8880e3b`); runner and an outputs-only amendment committed before the LP2 run (`7d44b09`). 34 LP keywords → 68 alphabets (K, K⁻¹, id) → 314,432 triples × 6 key families, C13's labelled LLR best over 87, exclude ≤ −10 (false exclusion ≤ e^−10 at any family size). `quagmire.keyed_alphabet` / `log_models` / `best_llr` (brute-force equal; identity reproduces C13). Gates: G1 0 / 300, G2 testable 100 % except hex 99.5 %, letters 13.3 %. **C19:** English ×3 and digits all excluded, hex 314,001, letters A–Z 103,864; best +6.51, no lead. Declared "every testable member excluded" failed (135 hex, 10,197 letters); LP2 sits inside the flat-cipher range → findings §20 | `8880e3b` `7d44b09` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **U** Quagmire relabelling | Declared first (`4051fe2`). Gates amended before LP2 was scored (`f2ecd72`): the declared G2/G3 had power and calibration swapped, caught by `--quick`; control draws raised to 100,000. `lpcore/quagmire.py` (encoder, C17 interval, exact λ per alphabet draw, vectorised noncentral CDF tested equal to `flatness`). U1 audit: the cipher is the additive one renamed (tested rune for rune). **C17:** iid key doublet rate in [2/29 − Σb², Σb²] under any labels; the deficit needs Σb² > 0.05925. **C18:** G1 within 0.23 %, G3 0 / 20 in all 24 rows; 20 rows excluded (worst P 1.7e-11, no draw reaches λ_max), letters A–Z untestable (power ≤ 2 / 20). C13's letters exclusion now straight alphabets only. Declared Σb² 0.06233 was a rounding slip (0.06232) → findings §19 | `4051fe2` `f2ecd72` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **T** flatness of random tabulae | Declared first (`f0c8e39`; that commit was red on `tests/test_docs.py`, since it cited files not yet written). `lpcore/flatness.py`: exact even-df χ² CDFs, the random-σ scale model, boundaries. Gates passed: A within −7.1…−1.5 %, B 0 / 200 at 1e-4 and 7 % at 0.05. **C16:** V_eff ≤ 168 pooled / 174 per section by the declared rule; 153 / 133 after a post-run anti-doublet correction (×0.939, from the additive control), which the findings quote. 15 / 20 stage S classings excluded; raw bytes open. The declared "power" rows were really calibration (0 false exclusions), relabelled. → findings §18 | `f0c8e39` + this |

| 2026-10-01 | **S** per-position alphabets, label-free | Declared first (`8c93b22`). DM detector `lpcore/alphabets.py` (exact mean-1 null, FFT = direct counts, in-step power, no power at 1 % desync). C9 shown to flag σ-periodic keys (P 500, 1000). The 20 classings × 10 alignments run is **VOID twice** by the declared rule. Run 1: the tiled 2,901-rune control text shared the plaintext keys' period (negatives +904…+1,104). Run 2, word-shuffled text: Liber AL negative +53.5, because random-σ control ciphers are not flat (χ² 1,141 / 355.6 vs LP2 26.4). Real nulls ≤ −489.5; LP2 decodes ≤ +0.84, identical across runs. Nothing excluded. Stopped after two failed fixes (attempt budget) → findings §17 | `8c93b22` `2c62782` `3f5b830` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **PR #1** full grid | External PR (certified-retart) reviewed and merged: scan 68's 72 cells restored (256-byte grid), five cells per iddqd `f804b85` (checked against the upstream diff and scans 66–68; one I/l call is convention). Suite green on the PR branch; stage M/N TSVs regenerate byte-identical. Merged into local main with stage R/S | `4f326e5` `66c67a3` |
| 2026-10-01 | **R** Cicada numbers, OutGuess payloads | Declared first (`2c209dc`). 25 sources × 2 mappings (mod, rejection) × 3 modes × 29 shifts × 10 alignments = 43,500 drift-tolerant decodes, every start phase under a uniform prior (`detect.log_lr(starts=)`). None passes: best on a real section −50.8 vs +30; controls 200/200 ≥ +169.1. First run killed at the 2 h background limit, so `lpcore/fastdetect.py` (numpy, tested equal) was added and the unchanged family re-run. → findings §16 | `2c209dc` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **Q** consolidation | Declared first (`028ef53`). Register of every C/L number with its test (findings §0). C3 now a test: all 29 letters excluded (23 + AE/EO/OE by count, NG/IA/EA by position). C15: no homophonic substitution, least χ² 4,802 ≥ 200 (enumeration also allows unused runes, which can only lower the bound). §3.2 numbers pinned; `tests/test_docs.py` checks cited tests, paths, names, links. Errata: C3 "75" → 25.2, C7 "2.6 %" → 2.39 %. → findings §15 | `028ef53` + this |

New skills `lp-expert` (+ `lore.md`), `lp-attack` (+ `attack-catalog.md`), `lp-claim-audit`; repo overrides in 7 generic skills; `CLAUDE.md` index. All 23 cited `lpcore` names resolve; suite green. No research result changed | — (no tracked files besides this row) |
| 2026-10-01 | **O** skip-next rule | Declared first (directional statistic new; L1 χ² already seen). C14: LLR −21.3 ≤ −10, skip-next excluded; robust to held-out Δp models (−20/−32). → findings §14 | `0d4d86b` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **N** historical grid prefix | Declared first (PGP rule amended before the run). The original 184-byte prefix gave 72 byte decryptions + 384 rune readings: none passed (best 44 % printable; best log LR −4.8). Superseded by the full-grid rerun. → findings §13, `tools/run_stage_n.py`, `tests/test_grid.py` | `14afdff` + this |
