# TODO — Liber Primus

The working plan. **Write a plan here before the first edit** (AGENTS.md): goal, approach, rejected
alternatives, what you're *not* doing, blast radius, rollback. When a stage is done, collapse it to one line
under "Done" with its commits. The full text stays in git history. Status and next research steps live in
[`MASTER_TRACKER.md`](MASTER_TRACKER.md) §1, not here.

## Active

*(none. The next research step is MASTER_TRACKER §1, item 1. Plan it here before starting.)*

## Owner items

- [ ] **Tokens in `.claude/mcp.vscode-reference.json`** (GitHub PAT, mem0, context7) are plaintext. They were never
  committed or pushed (full-history scan on 2026-09-29), so rotating them is optional. Consider VS Code `inputs`
  (`promptString`, `password: true`) instead of hardcoding them.

## Done

| Date | Stage | Result | Commits |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-01 | **S** per-position alphabets, label-free | Declared first (`8c93b22`). DM detector `lpcore/alphabets.py` (exact mean-1 null, FFT = direct counts, in-step power, no power at 1 % desync). C9 shown to flag σ-periodic keys (P 500, 1000). The 20 classings × 10 alignments run is **VOID twice** by the declared rule. Run 1: the tiled 2,901-rune control text shared the plaintext keys' period (negatives +904…+1,104). Run 2, word-shuffled text: Liber AL negative +53.5, because random-σ control ciphers are not flat (χ² 1,141 / 355.6 vs LP2 26.4). Real nulls ≤ −489.5; LP2 decodes ≤ +0.84, identical across runs. Nothing excluded. Stopped after two failed fixes (attempt budget) → findings §17 | `8c93b22` `2c62782` `3f5b830` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **PR #1** full grid | External PR (certified-retart) reviewed and merged: scan 68's 72 cells restored (256-byte grid), five cells per iddqd `f804b85` (checked against the upstream diff and scans 66–68; one I/l call is convention). Suite green on the PR branch; stage M/N TSVs regenerate byte-identical. Merged into local main with stage R/S | `4f326e5` `66c67a3` |
| 2026-10-01 | **R** Cicada numbers, OutGuess payloads | Declared first (`2c209dc`). 25 sources × 2 mappings (mod, rejection) × 3 modes × 29 shifts × 10 alignments = 43,500 drift-tolerant decodes, every start phase under a uniform prior (`detect.log_lr(starts=)`). None passes: best on a real section −50.8 vs +30; controls 200/200 ≥ +169.1. First run killed at the 2 h background limit, so `lpcore/fastdetect.py` (numpy, tested equal) was added and the unchanged family re-run. → findings §16 | `2c209dc` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **Q** consolidation | Declared first (`028ef53`). Register of every C/L number with its test (findings §0). C3 now a test: all 29 letters excluded (23 + AE/EO/OE by count, NG/IA/EA by position). C15: no homophonic substitution, least χ² 4,802 ≥ 200 (enumeration also allows unused runes, which can only lower the bound). §3.2 numbers pinned; `tests/test_docs.py` checks cited tests, paths, names, links. Errata: C3 "75" → 25.2, C7 "2.6 %" → 2.39 %. → findings §15 | `028ef53` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **P** agent skills | Now tracked: `CLAUDE.md` and the 10 enabled skills under `.claude/skills/` (tokens and local settings stay ignored). New skills `lp-expert` (+ `lore.md`), `lp-attack` (+ `attack-catalog.md`), `lp-claim-audit`; repo overrides in 7 generic skills; `CLAUDE.md` index. All 23 cited `lpcore` names resolve; suite green. No research result changed | — (no tracked files besides this row) |
| 2026-10-01 | **O** skip-next rule | Declared first (directional statistic new; L1 χ² already seen). C14: LLR −21.3 ≤ −10, skip-next excluded; robust to held-out Δp models (−20/−32). → findings §14 | `0d4d86b` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **N** historical grid prefix | Declared first (PGP rule amended before the run). The original 184-byte prefix gave 72 byte decryptions + 384 rune readings: none passed (best 44 % printable; best log LR −4.8). Superseded by the full-grid rerun. → findings §13, `tools/run_stage_n.py`, `tests/test_grid.py` | `14afdff` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **M** historical base-60 prefix | Declared first. Scans 66–67 supplied 184 bytes and omitted scan 68. Its 3,132 key tests gave no pass (best −5.5 on a real alignment; power check +45…+122). Superseded by the full-grid rerun. → findings §12, `tools/run_stage_m.py` | `4d66364` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **L** key alphabets | Rules and predictions declared first. C13: no decimal-digit (−214), hex (−19.5), letter (−14.3) or English-Latin (−122) key, best of 87 mode/offsets; controls +24…+251. Bytes, 00–99, base 60 untestable this way. → findings §11 | `0c59200` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **K** ciphertext-selected alphabets | Rule declared first. C12: off-diagonal lag-L transition χ² flat for L = 1–1000 (best p 3.9e-3 vs 1e-5); calibration conservative; controls χ² 7.6k–14k. Subsumes C11. → findings §10 | `55c78b1` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **J** key statistics | Rules declared first. C10: no English running key from any text, in 3 mappings × 3 modes × 29 offsets (LLR −255…−333; still excluded at λ = 0.25). C11: no ciphertext autokey at lags 2–1000 (best p 5.6e-4 vs 5e-6). Title cribs closed as untestable. → findings §9, `tests/test_keyspace.py` | `b1fa1bb` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **I** key-source riddles | Plan, thresholds and candidate list declared first. Drift-tolerant detector (`detect.py`, forward algorithm, bound e^−30). Controls pass except AN END (85 runes, 29.6 < 30: too short, recorded). C9: no periodic key (lags 11–1000). 2,610 decodes of primes / word sums / plaintext values all fail (best −65 nats on a real section). Segment 10 title not decoded by the square. → findings §8. `tools/run_stage_i.py`, `tests/test_detect.py` | `8641c50` `3720710` |
| 2026-10-01 | **H** characterise the doublet leak | Predictions L1–L5 declared here, then run. Survivors are random at a constant ≈ 19 % (no nudge, no per-line check, no period, no clustering; C6 now a test). Key-switch refuted. New exact constraint C8 → findings §7. `tools/lpcore/leak.py`, `tests/test_leak.py` | `d66cbb2` |
| 2026-10-01 | **G** organise for clarity | `.gitattributes` (LF). `reference/` split into findings/sources/community/archive; `data/` split into canonical/corpora/outguess/archive, each with a README. Duplicate `key_search_corpus.txt` removed. Tracker rewritten as resume-here; old one archived verbatim. README rewritten | `d008cb2` `fe7588b` `8b143c1` + this |
| 2026-10-01 | **F** remove other-project material | `.agent/` (mcMMO memory), Ko-fi `FUNDING.yml`, mcMMO workflows deleted (identical copies in `../mcMMO-Singleplayer`). AGENTS.md rewritten for LP | `f5ca9a1` |
| 2026-09-29 | **E** archive legacy | 107 scripts → `tools/legacy/`; outputs → `data/archive/hillclimbers/20260529/` (`MOVES.txt` lists all 301 moves for reversal) | `50889e8` |
| 2026-09-29 | **D** logic-only analysis | Constraints C1–C7, scan-32 square decoded, 2026 web check → `reference/findings/`, `reference/community/community_research.md` | `f038274` `a85c106` |
| 2026-09-29 | **C** tracker correction | Invalid claims identified (now MASTER_TRACKER §4.3) | `a85c106` |
| 2026-09-29 | **B** canonical corpus | rtkd/iddqd master vendored; `tools/lpcore` + tests; 150 page files rebuilt from it | `f038274` |
| 2026-09-29 | **A** push safety | Tokens and foreign material git-ignored. History scanned: no secret ever committed | `f5ca9a1` |

Rollback for any stage: `git revert <commit>`. Untracked archive moves are reversed with `MOVES.txt`.
